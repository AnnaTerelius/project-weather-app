This project was to in 1 week build a weather app, fetch data from an open API and show todays weather and temperature and a 3 to 5-day forecast, to style it and make it responsive.

To build this I learned about API:S and basic JSON, I used fetch() and promises and Date() in Javascript. I made it change image depending on weather and as a stech goal I made the background gradient when misty.
