This project was created during the Technigo boot camp.

This weeks project was to build a weather app, fetch data from openweathermap.org's open API and show todays weather and temperature and a 3 to 5-day forecast, to style it and make it responsive.

To create this I learned about API:s and basic JSON. I used fetch() and promises and Date() in Javascript. I made it change image depending on weather and as a stech goal I made the background gradient when misty.
